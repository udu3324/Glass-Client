## What Is Glass Client?
Glass Client is **not** a simple MC client. It hooks into MC very different from plain regular clients and features things such as **AI modules**. AI limits some things such as easy configuration but can allow the client to sit onto MC and be as **invisible as glass.** (hence the name) For example with aimAI toggled on, the client will **not act like a robot**. It will **act like a normal human**. This makes the end user **look very legit** and have a **massive advantage**.

## Glass Client Is Still A Work In Progress
Glass Client is still a work in progress. There are some features that are not added yet and will be added later. Things not added yet are the **module editor**, **better UI**, and more.
